    <Philosophical-Ideas>Life is shit. It&apos;s those that can push past the shit barrier that make it in this universe as true leaders, instead of just being another sheep in our growing herd. There is no afterlife, just this one chance to make our mark on the world/s, so use it wisely and keep trying. Remember that the only person stopping you from reaching the top is yourself, and yourself alone. It&apos;s not your teachers, superiors, friends, parents, whoever. Just you. So stop over analyzing every little thing you do, and get your ass out there and do something!</Philosophical-Ideas>

        <ASVAB-Score-Note>&quot;I&apos;m not stupid,&quot;, Shepard justifying her score to Alliance Recruter. &quot;I just got bored in school. I already knew hald the shit they were spewing and repeating over and over again. If they wanted to be lazy while teachin, I could be lazy with listening. Besided, all the inf was in the text.&quot;</ASVAB-Score-Note>

        <Pre-Alliance-History>Little is known about Shepard before she joined the Alliance. What is known is that she was a part of a group called the Reds while on Earth. She was also a suspect for the murder of Alfred J. Phillips when she was 16. The charges were dropped due to the murder being committed in self defiance to prevent her own rape. When she reached age 18, all accounts of the incident were expunged from her record. (Footage and record of file here.)</Pre-Alliance-History>
        <Reasons-for-Joining-Alliance>Footage taken from Alliance Recruitment Station: Shepard sitting across from Recruiter while discussing a career with the Alliance, &quot;I could lie to you and tell you that I want structure in my life, as well as the opportunity to interact with different species from all across the galaxy; but really, I just want something that guarantees me a hot meal three times a day. I&apos;ve been living on half eaten paste tubes for the past three years. Actual food would be welcome. Combine that with weapon and hand-to-hand combat training, who could say no to the Alliance?&quot;</Reasons-for-Joining-Alliance>

            <Early-Enlistment>Taken from datapad of one, Robert J. Yerkes, &quot;Miss. Shepard is eager to prove and further herself in every way she can. She has proven to be assertive and a natural leader. Yet, her DS mentioned to hearing her laugh hysterically at the firing range and during G-Training. When confronted on this, she commented that, &apos;This is the most fun I&apos;ve had in my entire life!&apos; She should be closely watched for possible mental instabilities.&quot;</Early-Enlistment>
            <First-Mission-Post-Basics>Sole Survivor, due to thresher maw attack in a small colony on Akuze; 2177, Age: 23. (Taken from vid with therapist about incident: &quot;After my panic gave way to adrenalin, I just unloaded as many rounds into the thing as I could and hoped for the best. Oh, and a grenade launcher and some rockets helped, a-lot.&quot;)</First-Mission-Post-Basics>
            <Personality>Compromiser; only slightly more Paragon than Renegade. (Loyal to the Alliance and her crew, everyone else is seen as fair game regardless of gender. Other note: She refuses to harm children, even if said children are sent to kill her. This does not mean she will lie down, &quot;maiming is not the same as killing.&quot; Shepard also has issues with people who do not take her seriously. Refer to footage taken during Council interactions.)</Personality>

        <Special-Talents>Has an impressive memory for memorizing a battlefield and using it to her advantage within seconds of engaging an enemy. Also has a knack for mechanical functioning and maintenance.</Special-Talents>
